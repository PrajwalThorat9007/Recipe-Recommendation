# Recipe-Recommendation
📌 Project Overview
Recipe Recommender is a web application that leverages AI to suggest personalized recipes based on ingredients provided by the user. The goal is to help users generate cooking ideas quickly using the ingredients they already have. The project integrates modern DevOps practices including version control, CI/CD, containerization, and cloud deployment to ensure reliable and scalable performance.

🔧 Required Setup
To run and deploy this project successfully, ensure you have the following tools installed and configured:

✅ Version Control
GitHub
Used for managing and storing source code and version history.

⚙️ Continuous Integration
Jenkins
Automates the CI/CD pipeline. On each code push, Jenkins pulls the latest code, builds the project, runs automated tests, and creates Docker images.

📦 Containerization
Docker
Packages the application into a portable container. It ensures consistency across all environments by bundling code with its dependencies.

☸️ Container Orchestration (Optional/Future Scope)
Kubernetes
Manages containerized applications in clusters. Helps scale and monitor containers (e.g., nginx server) efficiently.

☁️ Deployment
AWS EC2
Hosts and runs the Docker containers in a cloud environment. EC2 provides scalability and remote access to the deployed application.

🚀 How It Works
User provides a list of ingredients on the frontend
The backend AI model processes the input and recommends suitable recipes.
Jenkins triggers a CI/CD pipeline on each update.
Docker builds the app and stores the image.
The container is deployed on AWS EC2 for public access.
